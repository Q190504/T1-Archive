            <h1>A MESSAGE FROM THE ARCHIVERS</h1>
            <h2>HELLO!</h2>
            <p>Welcome to the ZOFGK Archive, composed of Videos, News and Media Articles, and all the games of this roster together throughout the years.</p>
            <p>This archive is updated automatically after every new content and games that come available. This archive will continue as long as ZOFGK are still together as a roster.</p>
            <p>We hope this is a helpful file for new and current fans who want to get to know more about ZOFGK and reminsce the different contents and games that they have gone through together.</p>
            <h3>THIS WEBSITE IS BEST USED ON A PC/LAPTOP/TABLET.</h3>
            <p>This archive may not be the most aesthetically pleasing, but it is an easier tool for us as we have walls of texts. The archive is also not 100% done, as we will be adding content from 2021, too. We hope for your understanding.</p>

            <h4>How to use this archive?</h4>
            <p>In the <strong>Videos page</strong> and <strong>Media Interviews/News Articles page</strong>, links are placed in the video title link. Before it, there's an indication if it has English subtitles or not in the original content. A link is attached under "YES" if it is subtitled by a third-party. The next tab shows which players are present in the content/interview.</p>
            <p>Every row has a <strong>descriptions or highlights column</strong> to easily help you navigate what the content is about or what happened during the game.</p>
            <p>You may also use the tags to help you find similar content grouped together. On your browser, you may <strong>press Ctrl+F to activate the search bar</strong>.</p>
            
            <hr>

            <h4>Please help us!</h4>
            <p style="text-align: center;">Report to the archivers if any links are broken. Please help us by spreading the link to a lot of people, too!</p>
